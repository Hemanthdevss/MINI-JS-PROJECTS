# Mini Projects Repository

Welcome to my mini projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of small web projects that I've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects serve as a playground for experimenting with web development and honing my skills.

Feel free to explore the projects and use them as examples or starting points for your own web development endeavors.

## Contributions

If you'd like to contribute to any of these projects or provide feedback, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue. I'm open to collaboration and learning from the community.
